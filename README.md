Trinket Mood Lamp
=================

This code is for a simple circuit based on AdaFruit's Trinket, to turn it into a mood lamp. Three LEDs and a button are connected to the Trinket. The Arduino IDE and Trinket drivers are used to upload these programs. Details for loading this up can be found here:

Originally, this code was developed to introduce the local girl scouts to microprocessors and electronics, but it should be able to provide anyone with a simple introduction to what can be accomplished with these type of devices. The code is intentionally commented heavily and written for comprehension instead of performance. 

Included in this repository are various Arduino sketches that will operate the LEDs in different ways. Options to include a button for interaction are also available.
