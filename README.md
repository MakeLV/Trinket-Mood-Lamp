Trinket Mood Lamp
=================

This code is for a simple circuit based on AdaFruit's Trinket, to turn it into a mood lamp. Three LEDs and a button are connected to the Trinket. The Arduino IDE and Trinket drivers are used to upload these programs. Details for loading this up can be found here:

This code is part of a simple course originally developed to introduce the local girl scouts to microprocessors and electronics, but it should be able to provide anyone with a simple introduction to what can be accomplished with these type of devices.

Included in this repository are various Arduino sketches that will operate the LEDs in different ways.
